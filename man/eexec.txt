<b>NAME</b>
	eexec - Extended Exec

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
	eexec <options> -arg <hexadecimal value>
	eexec <options> -src <[folder\]filename>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
	This soft is designed to offer a way to execute hexadecimal code like the "exec()" command of AMS, but it has options which improve it.

<b>OPTIONS</b>
	<b>-add</b> <[folder\]filename>
		add the file to the vat. The filename can contain a path. By default, eexec executes the code from RAM without adding it to the VAT.

	<b>-arc</b>	archive the file before running it.

	<b>-rem</b>	remove the file after having run it.

	<b>-arg</b> <hexadecimal value>
		built the hexa value to do a binary executable

	<b>-src</b> <[folder\]filename>
		use the specified file to get the hex value. It must be a text or a string file.
		A text file musn't have trailing spaces or EOL to be valid.

	<b>-dry</b>	don't run the built program. It will be added to the VAT if specified.
		It will do nothing if the file isn't added, but you will be sure that your hex value is valid if no error occurs.

	If both -arg and -src are specified, -src is ignored.
	If -arc or -rem are specified without -add, they are ignored.

<b>REQUIREMENT</b>
	PedroM 0.82 RC7 minimum is required. Don't use EExec with AMS, it will crash

<b>NOTES</b>
	If you run this program <l>archived</l=arc>, it won't consume any byte of RAM!
	This program can be run in multiple instances.
